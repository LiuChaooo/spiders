在近日举行的土耳其国际伊兹密尔音乐节上，当维也纳室内管弦乐团投入地演绎名曲时，音乐会出现了难以预料的一幕，一只狗狗循声而来，漫步走入了舞台中央。这只狗狗在占据了聆听音乐的最佳位置后，坐了下来，以舒服的方式聆听了整场音乐会，这一幕令现场观众忍俊不禁。
When the world-renowned Vienna Chamber Orchestra was recently performing at the 31st International Izmir Festival in Turkey, their concert was unexpectedly interrupted by a random dog. The canine walked on the stage, got the best seats, and made itself extra comfortable.
近日，全球著名的维也纳室内管弦乐团在土耳其第31届国际伊兹密尔音乐节上演出，而他们的音乐会意外地受到一只流浪狗的打扰。这只狗狗漫步到舞台上，找到最佳位置，舒服地坐了下来。
We see the doggie going towards one violinist, who continued playing to the best of his ability. Then the dog did what many of us wanted to do at some point in a classical music concert – that is, lay down and demonstratively yawn.
这只狗狗向一位小提琴演奏者走去，这位小提琴手继续保持着高水准的演奏。这时，这只狗狗做出了有时我们想在古典音乐会上做的事情——坐下来，打了个大大的哈欠。
Apparently, many people in the audience could sympathize with the pooch, as they gave him a few rounds of applause. I mean, even the musicians found it funny and did their best not to laugh.
显然，很多现场观众感觉这一幕非常可爱，他们给了狗狗数次掌声。正在演奏的音乐家们也感到好笑，都快绷不住笑出声来了。
We don’t know where the dog came from, or if it has an owner, but one thing is for sure – its performance on stage was one to remember.
没人知道这只狗从哪里来，是否有主人，但可以确定的是，大家都记住了它在舞台上的表现。
